How to play
The player starts with an empty square board representing a "minefield".
Click on a square in the table. If you accidentally hit a box with a mine
(this often happens to new players), the game is over. The other case is 
that the cell has no mines and an area of ??cells will be opened with numbers.
The number on a square is the number of mines in the 8 cells that are 
located around that tile.
If a cell is sure to have a mine, the player ticks that box with a flag image (right-click).
When 8 neighboring cells in a number already have enough mines and there are still other cells,
those cells have no mines
The game ends with the player winning if he opens all the boxes without mines.
The game is divided into three levels:
Easy (beginner): 9x9 square board on which 10 mines are spread
Mediate: 16x16 square board on which 40 mines are spread
Difficult (expert): 24x24 square board on which 99 mines are scattered
